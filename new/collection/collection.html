            I have been collecting trainers for as long as I can remember. I was quite young when I got into trainers as I had older
            siblings that were always getting the latest trainers. It was not until I got my first job that my addiction for trainers really began.
            I have around 150 pair (maybe more), I have not counted lol. My favourite brand is Nike and my favourite silhouette is the Air Force 1
