        <p>
            I have always loved Art and creative subjects since a child. However I stoped doing Art when I finished<br>my secondary school education in order to persue other things. <br>
            I decided not to persue art as I found it difficult to create for the sake of creating and so I started my degree in Social Work.<br>
            Fast forward two years, the job that I am currently at encouraged me to get back into creating art.<br> Initially I started creating clothing in the hopes to own my own fashion 
            brand one day, I began to lose interest in fashion design because I did not have the money to fund it.<br> I decided to start illustrating in late 2019 and by early 2020
            I was getting asked to illustrate for people.<br> I then decided to dedicate my time to art and have had the oppurtunity to work for some
            amazing people and global companies.
