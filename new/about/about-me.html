        <p>
            My name is Cherise, I am 25 years old and I am from a Caribbean background.<br>
            I currently reside in the South of London, with my sister, two nieces and nephew.<br>
            I have recently finished my four year degree in Social Work.<br>
            I currently work for a large tech company where I work as a technical specialist.<br>
            My current hobbies are Art and Illustration, Fashion.<br>
            As well as this, I am a doting "Sneakerhead" with a collection of well over 100 pairs of trainers and counting.<br>
            <br><br>

            I joined Nology because I have gained a interest in digging deeper in to technology, after working for a tech company.<br>
            I have also been interested in more of a creative career as I believe I am quite a creative individual and I think it will be something I will enjoy.
